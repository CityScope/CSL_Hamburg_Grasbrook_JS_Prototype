# CityScopeJS

CityScopeJS is a unified front-end for the [MIT CityScope](https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/) project, an [open-source](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_cityscopeJS) urban modeling and simulation platform. CityScopeJS allows users to test different design alternatives and observe their impact through multiple layers of urban analytics. CityScopeJS combines different urban analytics modules, such as traffic simulation, ABM, noise, storm-water, access.

## Quick Start

As of now, CityScopeJS is available for several projects:

To explore the app for a known CityScope project, add a CityScope project name to this page URL (for example, `__URL__/?cityscope=grasbrook` will run [CityScopeJS Grasbrook](https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/CS_cityscopeJS/?cityscope=grasbrook) project). You can also explore a list of active CityScope projects [here](https://cityio.media.mit.edu)

## Analysis modules

Different analysis modules calculate various indicators on urban performance, such as noise, mobility, energy and others. These analysis modules are developed by experts in each evaluation field.

## CityScopeJS Interface

CityScopeJS is an online tool with a web or tangible user interface (TUI). Using the tool, users can input land uses, buildings, open spaces or transport routes, categorize them and enrich their description with details on usability, density and other parameters. This input forms the basis for calculating the various modules and indicators.
