# CityScopeJS

CityScopeJS is a unified front-end for the [MIT CityScope](https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/) project, an [open-source](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_cityscopeJS) urban modeling and simulation platform. 
As of now, the tool is available for several projects. To start, add a CityScope project name to this page URL (for example, `__URL__/?grasbrook` will run [CityScopeJS Grasbrook](https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/CS_cityscopeJS/?grasbrook) project. Pay attention to the `?` after the URL). You can also explore a list of active CityScope projects [here](https://cityio.media.mit.edu)
