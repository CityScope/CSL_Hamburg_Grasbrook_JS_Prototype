# CityScopeJS

This repo contains CityScopeJS unified front-end for the [MIT CityScope](https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/) project, an [open-source](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_cityscopeJS) urban modeling and simulation platform.
As of now, the tool is available for several projects. To explore the app for a known CityScope project, add a CityScope project name to this page URL (for example, `__URL__/cityscope=grasbrook` will run [CityScopeJS Grasbrook](https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/CS_cityscopeJS/cityscope=grasbrook) project). You can also explore a list of active CityScope projects [here](https://cityio.media.mit.edu)
